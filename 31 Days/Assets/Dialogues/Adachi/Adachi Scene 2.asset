  - Let's be honest. There's nothing great about the real world, is there? It's just
    dull and annoying as hell.
  - "No one accepts that's the way things are\u2026 They're just stuck with it because
    they can't deny it, either."
  - "Those who actually succeed in life\u2026"
  - They just happen to be born with the magic ticket called "talent."
  - "Once you realize that, all you have left over in life is despair. The ultimate
    game over.\r"
